# Quizlet-Offline
Grab flashcards from Quizlet for reuse offline

This is made of two parts.  The C# ripper and the JS displayer.


## Ripper
You have to save copies of Quizlet pages via your browser to a directory. 
- You can save as many pages as you want to the directory.  The ripper will parse them all.

Run the C# program.  
- If you don't want to compile your own copy, there is a copy in __Quizlet-Offline-master/Ripper/QuizletRipper/bin/Debug/__

It will generate a **quizlet.js** file.  Copy this to __Quizlet-Offline-master/Displayer/__


## Displayer

Double-click **index.html**.  

That's it.
